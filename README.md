# CryptoApi

This project leverages FastAPI and cryptography in Python to demonstrate basic symmetric, asymmetric encryption and decryption operations. It provides a simple API for encoding and decoding messages using RSA keys. The project also includes a UI to interact with the API, thanks to FastAPI's integration with Swagger.
